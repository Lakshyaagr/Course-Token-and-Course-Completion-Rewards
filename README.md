# CourseToken and CourseCompletionRewards

## Project Description
This project consists of two smart contracts: `CourseToken` and `CourseCompletionRewards`. The `CourseToken` contract is an ERC20 token designed to reward students who complete blockchain development courses. The `CourseCompletionRewards` contract enables instructors to create courses and distribute token rewards to students upon successful course completion.

## Contract Address
0x0d01DCda7BD351d02880DD29bC7B399821fEe1ed

## Project Vision
The aim of this project is to incentivize learning in the field of blockchain development by rewarding students with cryptocurrency tokens upon successfully completing courses. This system creates a win-win situation for instructors and learners by promoting skill-building while integrating blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### CourseToken Contract
- **ERC20 Compliant Token:** Implements OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC20 standard.
- **Reward Distribution:** Tokens are distributed to students upon course completion.
- **Initial Token Supply:** A fixed supply of 1,000,000 CRT tokens minted to the contract itself.

### CourseCompletionRewards Contract
- **Course Creation:** Instructors can create courses by providing details such as course name, description, and reward amount.
- **Reward Management:** Tokens are distributed automatically to students who complete courses.
- **Student Progress Tracking:** Tracks the courses completed by each student to prevent duplicate rewards.
- **Transparency:** Maintains an on-chain record of courses, instructors, and student completions.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with a front-end application for user-friendly interaction.
- Support for NFT certificates upon course completion.
- Decentralized verification of course completions using oracles.
